# Welcome to Wack-A-Mole Game!

This project is a **Whack-A-Mole Game** created with React, TypeScript, Google Firebase Authentication, and Redux Toolkit.
Due to the shortage of time to build a complete project, I couldn't add any tests or mobile responsiveness to this App.

# Run the App Locally

1. Install dependencies **($ npm install/yarn install)**
2. Run the App with localhost **($yarn start)**
